class Playlist
  # trip_duration = TravelTime.new(params[:origins], params[:desitinations]) Create new TravelTime object.
  # Create new sample set of songs object using Ashley's code.  Would probably be best as a hash of songs that could be randomly pulled from.  Each hash item would probably be { artist => name, album => name, track => name, track_length => milliseconds }
  # while trip_duration > song_time_total
  #   playlist << track_item{artist, album, title, length}        shovel one hash item from Ashleys hash of hashes (or array of hashes) into a playlist.
